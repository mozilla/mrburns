          Anyone who uses Firefox helps shape the future of the Web and that's something we want to celebrate. That's why this number represents new downloads, automatic updates and any sharing that happens from this page - the worldwide impact of our global community. If you're interested in how it all works, you can <a href="{{ url }}">check out the blog post.</a>
